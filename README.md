This is a simple test project which I used to develop a method to render on top of the RViz2 scene after the old approach from RViz did not work anymore.
It is used in the [hector_rviz_overlay](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_rviz_overlay) (though in a fixed and more production ready version).

Feel free to use this experimental package for any purposes.
I don't give any warranties or claim that it will work for you.
I've tested it with an intel and an nvidia gpu.
